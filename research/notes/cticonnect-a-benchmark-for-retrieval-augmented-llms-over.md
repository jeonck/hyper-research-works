Abstract
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is foundational to modern cyberse-
curity, enabling organizations to proactively defend against evolv-
ing threats. However, the sheer volume and heterogeneity of CTI
data, spanning structured knowledge bases (CVE, CWE, CAPEC,
MITRE ATT&CK) and unstructured threat reports, far exceed the
capacity of manual analysis. The strong contextual understanding
and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
driven growing research interest in applying them to CTI tasks. Yet
no existing benchmark evaluates LLMs in a retrieval-augmented set-
ting with a proper evaluation harness—one that grants access to the
heterogeneous domain knowledge sources analysts rely on in prac-
tice. To address this gap, we present CTIConnect, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating retrieval-augmented LLMs across the CTI
task landscape. We construct a unified evaluation environment in-
tegrating five heterogeneous CTI sources into 1,860 expert-verified
QA pairs spanning nine tasks across three categories: Entity Link-
ing, Multi-Document Synthesis, and Entity Attribution. Extensive
experiments on ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that the cross-
source semantic gap manifests differently across task categories,
demanding fundamentally different retrieval strategies, and that the
performance bottleneck shifts between retrieval infrastructure and
evidence utilization depending on the task. Our domain-specific
strategies further outperform stronger general-purpose retrieval
paradigms (retrieve-then-rerank, IRCoT), showing that closing this
gap requires structural interventions rather than generic retrieval
improvements. These findings hold across all ten LLMs, remain
consistent on the full benchmark, and stay stable under temporal
splits spanning 2008–2025. Together, they provide actionable guid-
ance for designing scalable knowledge retrieval architectures over
large-scale, heterogeneous CTI ecosystems.

Introduction
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is foundational to modern cyberse-
curity defense, enabling organizations to shift from reactive incident
response to proactive threat anticipation [33]. However, the CTI
data ecosystem is both massive and heterogeneous, spanning struc-
tured knowledge bases (CVE, CWE, CAPEC, MITRE ATT&CK)
and unstructured vendor threat reports that employ fundamen-
tally different schemas, vocabularies, and abstraction levels. The
volume and heterogeneity of this ecosystem far exceed the capac-
ity of manual analysis to scale. The contextual understanding and
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) position
them as a natural candidate for addressing this challenge, driv-
ing a growing body of research on LLM-powered CTI analysis,
from extracting structured threat information from narrative re-
ports [6, 13, 28, 41] to constructing comprehensive cybersecurity
knowledge graphs [5, 12, 15]. Industry interest is also growing:
platforms such as Microsoft Security Copilot [24] now integrate
LLMs into operational CTI workflows for real-time threat analysis.
As interest in applying LLMs to CTI analysis grows, rigorous
benchmarks become essential for evaluating model performance
in this domain. Yet existing CTI benchmarks address only a frac-
tion of this need: CTIBench [2] tests parametric knowledge under
closed-book settings, and SEvenLLM [16] measures gains from

domain-specific fine-tuning. Neither paradigm reflects how LLMs
are deployed for CTI in practice. CTI knowledge evolves rapidly:
new vulnerabilities are disclosed daily, threat reports are published
continuously, and adversary behaviors shift faster than any retrain-
ing cycle can follow. The volume of accumulated domain knowledge
far exceeds what parametric memory can internalize, yet factual
precision remains critical for downstream detection and response.
These characteristics make retrieval-augmented generation (where
models actively retrieve and reason over external knowledge at in-
ference time) a prerequisite for any production CTI system. Yet no
existing benchmark evaluates this capability, leaving a fundamen-
tal question unanswered: What retrieval strategies enable LLMs to
most effectively leverage external knowledge across the heterogeneous,
multi-source CTI ecosystem?
Answering this question is non-trivial. General-purpose RAG
benchmarks [4, 11, 34, 43] typically evaluate retrieval over homo-
geneous corpora, but the CTI data ecosystem is fundamentally het-
erogeneous: it spans structured knowledge bases that encode infor-
mation in formal, technique-oriented terminology (e.g., T1003.001
– LSASS Memory) and unstructured vendor reports that describe
the same behaviors in analyst-authored narrative prose (e.g., “the
adversary harvested credentials from memory”). This heterogeneity
creates a cross-source semantic gap: queries expressed in one vo-
cabulary systematically fail to match relevant evidence encoded in
another, causing vanilla embedding-based retrieval to break down.
The gap is further compounded by the scale and complexity of
the CTI ecosystem: four major knowledge bases [8, 25–27] main-
tain hundreds of thousands of cross-source mappings, while re-
ports from dozens of vendors reference the same entities under
inconsistent aliases (e.g., the same Russian state-sponsored threat
group appears as “APT29,” “Cozy Bear,” or “Nobelium” depending
on the vendor). A concrete illustration of why such correlation is
operationally valuable is the Magniber ransomware family: cross-
source analysis links a 2023 SmartScreen-bypass campaign to a 2021
PrintNightmare-based variant and a 2017 South Korea targeting
campaign, revealing a six-year operational continuity invisible to
single-report analysis (Section A.4). No existing benchmark cap-
tures these cross-source retrieval challenges, making it impossible
to assess whether current retrieval strategies are adequate for pro-
duction CTI systems.
To address these challenges, we present CTIConnect, a bench-
mark for systematically evaluating retrieval strategies for LLM-
based CTI analysis. We make two complementary contributions.
First, we construct a unified heterogeneous CTI evaluation environ-
ment integrating five major knowledge bases (CVE, CWE, CAPEC,
MITRE ATT&CK, and vendor threat reports) into nine tasks across
three categories (Entity Linking, Multi-Document Synthesis, Entity
Attribution) that cover all cross-source directions in CTI analy-
sis (Table I). Second, we design domain-specific retrieval strategies
tailored to each task category’s semantic gap characteristics and
evaluate them against vanilla RAG baselines across ten LLMs span-
ning open-source and proprietary families. Experiments show that
domain-specific strategies yield substantial improvements over
vanilla RAG (up to +35.2% for entity linking, +16.0% for attribution,
and +11.3% for synthesis), with optimal strategies varying by task
category. We further show that this advantage cannot be replicated
by stronger general-purpose retrieval paradigms: retrieve-then-
rerank and IRCoT recover at most 1–5% of the gap that our domain-
specific strategies close, confirming that bridging the cross-source
gap requires structural interventions rather than generic retrieval
improvements. These findings hold across ten LLMs, remain consis-
tent on the full 1,860-pair benchmark, and stay stable under per-task
temporal splits across the 2008–2025 span. In summary, this paper
makes the following contributions:
• Benchmark. We construct and release CTIConnect, the first
retrieval-augmented evaluation environment for CTI analysis,
integrating structured knowledge bases (CVE, CWE, CAPEC,
MITRE ATT&CK) and unstructured threat reports from 35
sources into 1,860 expert-verified QA pairs spanning nine core
security analysis tasks across three categories.
• Retrieval Strategies. We design domain-specific retrieval strate-
gies that bridge the distinct semantic gap characteristics of each
task category, and contrast them with vanilla RAG as well as
stronger general-purpose paradigms.
• Findings. Systematic evaluation of ten LLMs reveals that the
cross-source semantic gap undermines both retrieval accuracy
and evidence utilization to varying degrees across task categories.
Our analysis examines the failure modes of current retrieval
strategies and provides insights for future RAG improvements
in CTI systems. We release CTIConnect at cticonnect.github.io
and invite the community to evaluate new approaches on our
benchmark and to build upon our retrieval-strategy findings.

Cyber Threat Intelligence. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is
evidence-based knowledge about existing or emerging cyber threats
that enables organizations to anticipate and defend against adver-
sary activities [19, 23]. Such intelligence ultimately supports down-
stream defensive operations such as attack investigation, which
analyzes large-scale system provenance to reconstruct multi-step
attacks like APTs [38]. Structured CTI comprises interconnected
knowledge bases: CVE [8] catalogs vulnerabilities, CWE [26] cap-
tures underlying weakness patterns, CAPEC [25] documents attack
patterns, and MITRE ATT&CK [27] organizes adversary techniques.
These sources encode knowledge at varying abstraction levels us-
ing formal, technique-oriented terminology. Unstructured CTI
consists of vendor threat reports (e.g., CrowdStrike [7], Unit 42 [29],
Trend Micro [36]) that describe adversary activities in narrative
form. These sources are inherently noisy: actionable intelligence
such as threat actor identities, malware lineage, and campaign pro-
gression is buried within lengthy prose, and the same entity may
surface under different aliases across vendors (e.g., “APT29,” “Cozy
Bear,” “Nobelium”). Together, these heterogeneous sources form
a fast-evolving, knowledge-intensive ecosystem whose scale and
update velocity make retrieval-augmented approaches essential for
production CTI systems.
CTI Benchmarks. Although LLM benchmarks have proliferated
in general cybersecurity [17, 18, 31, 35, 39, 45, 46], only a few have
targeted the CTI domain. CTIBench [2] was a notable effort, evaluat-
ing LLMs on four tasks: root cause mapping, vulnerability severity
prediction, attack technique extraction, and threat actor attribution.
However, these tasks capture only a narrow slice of the CTI analy-
sis landscape. CTIBench also evaluated only a few models under
closed-book settings, relying solely on parametric knowledge with-
out retrieval or augmentation. Its dataset was manually curated
at small scale, making it difficult to extend to emerging threats.
Another effort, SEvenLLM [16], introduced SEvenLLM-Bench, a
bilingual multi-task dataset covering 28 CTI-related tasks (13 un-
derstanding and 15 generation). The benchmark is restricted to
single-report extraction and summarization, and limits evaluation
to instruction-tuned small models (≤14B parameters), excluding
frontier LLMs that may exhibit stronger reasoning capabilities.
LLMs for Security. The rapid advancement of LLMs has catalyzed
growing research across diverse cybersecurity domains, spanning
vulnerability detection [10, 40], fuzz testing [42, 44], reverse engi-
neering [20], intrusion detection [21], penetration testing [9], and
smart contract analysis [14]. Among these domains, CTI analysis
is particularly knowledge-intensive. Early work extracted struc-
tured information from narrative reports, such as TTPs [3, 6] and
STIX bundles [32]; later studies moved to relation modeling and
cybersecurity knowledge graph construction [1, 5, 15]. More recent
efforts have applied LLMs to downstream CTI operations such as
automated detection rule extraction from cloud-based threat intel-
ligence [30] and agentic CTI workflows that orchestrate multi-step
analysis pipelines [22]. However, these efforts share a common par-
adigm: extracting useful knowledge from CTI sources or training
models to internalize domain knowledge. We approach the problem
from a complementary angle: evaluating whether LLMs can serve
as an intermediate reasoning layer that connects analysts with the
full heterogeneous CTI ecosystem, by retrieving and integrating
cross-source knowledge on demand.

CTIConnect Design
CTIConnect systematically evaluates retrieval strategies for LLM-
based CTI analysis. We first define the task landscape that the
benchmark covers (§3.1), then describe the heterogeneous data
sources that support each task category and the construction pro-
cess that ensures data quality (§3.1.7).
3.1
Task Design
CTI analysis operates over heterogeneous data spanning structured
knowledge bases and unstructured threat reports. We organize the
core cross-source operations into three task categories based on
the source types they bridge: Entity Linking (structured →struc-
tured) aligns entries across CTI taxonomies; Entity Attribution (un-
structured →structured) grounds narrative descriptions to formal
taxonomy entries; and Multi-Document Synthesis (unstructured →
unstructured) aggregates intelligence scattered across vendor re-
ports. Together, these categories cover all cross-source directions
over heterogeneous CTI data, enabling systematic evaluation of
retrieval strategies under distinct semantic gap conditions.
3.1.1
Entity Linking. Entity linking tasks map an entry in one struc-
tured CTI knowledge base to its corresponding entry in another.
The retrieval space is vast: the model must discriminate among
900+ CWE categories, 200K+ CVE records, or 500+ CAPEC patterns
to identify a correct match. In addition, subtle distinctions between
semantically similar entries (e.g., CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write vs.

CTIConnect: A Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented LLMs over Heterogeneous Cyber Threat Intelligence
KDD ’26, August 09–13, 2026, Jeju Island, Republic of Korea
CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read) demand precise vocabulary align-
ment, making canonicalization the primary retrieval bottleneck.
We define four tasks spanning the major CTI knowledge bases:
❶CTI-RCM (Root Cause Mapping, CVE →CWE) identifies the
underlying weakness category of a disclosed vulnerability from
its CVE description, mapping terse, vendor-specific language to
the correct abstract weakness class. ❷CTI-WIM (Weakness In-
stantiation Mapping, CWE →CVE) reverses this direction: given
an abstract weakness description, the model identifies a concrete
CVE that instantiates it. ❸CTI-ATD (Attack Technique Derivation,
CAPEC →ATT&CK) maps a CAPEC attack pattern to its corre-
sponding MITRE ATT&CK technique, aligning two overlapping
but independently maintained taxonomies with differing granular-
ity. ❹CTI-ESD (Exploitation Surface Discovery, CWE →CAPEC)
reasons from the defensive perspective (weakness) to the offensive
perspective (attack pattern), identifying how a given weakness can
be exploited.
3.1.2
Entity Attribution. Entity attribution tasks ground narrative
attack or vulnerability descriptions in threat reports to formal en-
tries in structured CTI taxonomies. Analyst-authored narratives
employ action-oriented language (e.g., “the adversary harvested cre-
dentials from memory”) that differs fundamentally from technique-
oriented taxonomy terminology (e.g., T1003.001 – LSASS Memory),
creating a vocabulary mismatch that generic embeddings cannot
bridge. The one-to-many nature further compounds the difficulty:
a single passage may describe multiple interleaved behaviors, re-
quiring decomposition into atomic actions, independent retrieval
per behavior, and aggregation of results.
❶CTI-ATA (Attack Technique Attribution, Report →ATT&CK
entries) identifies all MITRE ATT&CK techniques described in a
threat report passage by decomposing complex behavioral narra-
tives into atomic actions, even when a single sentence conflates mul-
tiple tactics (e.g., lateral movement and credential access). ❷CTI-
VCA (Vulnerability Catalog Attribution, Report →CWE entries)
identifies all CWE weakness categories referenced in a vulnerability
exploitation narrative. The challenge is amplified by indirection:
reports describe exploitation effects rather than naming weaknesses
directly, requiring the model to infer root causes from observable
consequences.
3.1.3
Multi-Document Synthesis. Multi-document synthesis tasks
aggregate intelligence about the same entity scattered across multi-
ple vendor threat reports. Unlike entity attribution where vocabu-
lary mismatch is the primary barrier, synthesis faces a distinct chal-
lenge: entity aliasing. Different vendors describe the same threat
actor, malware family, or campaign under inconsistent naming
conventions (e.g., “APT29,” “Cozy Bear,” and “Nobelium”), creating
near-miss distractors that outscore gold documents in embedding
space and producing the largest semantic gap of any task category.
We define three tasks along distinct analytical dimensions:
❶CTI-TAP (Threat Actor Profiling) synthesizes a comprehensive
actor profile (covering TTPs, targets, and toolsets) from reports
referencing the same group under different aliases, requiring im-
plicit entity resolution before aggregation. ❷CTI-MLA (Malware
Lineage Analysis) traces the evolutionary lineage of a malware
family across reports on related variants, identifying capability
progression and code reuse through temporal reasoning over
Table II: Benchmark data summary. CTIConnect comprises
1,860 expert-verified QA pairs spanning nine tasks across
three data sources, distinguished by their ground-truth char-
acteristics and produced through a single unified construc-
tion pipeline (§3.1.7).

❸CTI-CSC (Campaign Storyline Construction) reconstructs a
coherent campaign timeline from reports documenting different
phases of the same operation, reconciling fragmented, partially
overlapping accounts into a unified narrative with consistent
chronology.
3.1.4
Structured Cross-Source Mappings. (Supporting Entity Link-
ing tasks.) The four entity linking tasks rely on authoritative
mappings maintained by security standards across interconnected
CTI knowledge bases: CVE→CWE (vulnerability to root cause),
CWE→CVE (weakness to instantiation), CWE→CAPEC (weakness
to attack pattern), and CAPEC→ATT&CK (attack pattern to adver-
sary technique). These mappings are curated by MITRE and NVD,
encompassing 200K+ CVE–CWE pairs and 500+ CAPEC–ATT&CK
relationships. From these mappings we construct 1,139 QA pairs
across the four linking tasks, spanning diverse vulnerability types
and abstraction levels. As the ground truth derives from the official
knowledge bases, factual reliability is inherently guaranteed.
3.1.5
Blog-to-Framework Alignments. (Supporting Entity Attribu-
tion tasks.) The two attribution tasks require ground-truth mappings
from narrative passages in threat reports to formal taxonomy en-
tries. We construct a Blog-to-Framework (B2F) dataset that links
attack-behavior phrases in threat reports to ATT&CK techniques
or CWE categories, combining direct practitioner annotation with
LLM-assisted candidate mapping under expert verification. This
process yields 380 QA pairs spanning diverse attack behaviors and
vulnerability patterns, with each passage mapped to one or more
taxonomy entries.
3.1.6
Report Clusters. (Supporting Multi-Document Synthesis tasks.)
The three synthesis tasks require sets of topically related threat
reports about the same entity: a threat actor, malware family, or
campaign. We aggregate 321 reports from 35 vendor sources (e.g.,

† Bold: best; underline: second-best per column. CB = Closed-Book; VR = Vanilla RAG; DS = Domain-Specific strategy (EtR for Entity Linking, CSKG-guided for Multi-Doc
Synthesis, DtR for Entity Attribution). Multi-Doc Synthesis omits CB as the task inherently requires multi-document retrieval.
at least two distinct vendors are retained, and from these clusters
we derive 341 QA pairs across the three synthesis tasks.
3.1.7
Construction Pipeline. All three data sources share a uni-
fied three-stage construction pipeline (Fig. 2): ❶Seed annotation
establishes ground-truth correlations from authoritative sources.
For entity linking, these derive directly from official cross-source
mappings maintained by MITRE and NVD, ensuring inherent fac-
tual reliability. For entity attribution and multi-document synthesis,
seed correlations are established through dual expert annotation
with senior adjudication. ❷Template-constrained QA synthesis trans-
forms each correlation into task-specific question–answer pairs,
with prompt templates specifying the task instruction, input entity,
expected output, and required format. By grounding generation in
verified correlations, this step reduces hallucination while enabling
scalable data production. ❸Multi-layered quality control enforces
annotation reliability through three mechanisms: an LLM-based
judge (GPT-4) filters low-confidence samples via a structured rubric,
two domain practitioners independently verify the remaining pairs,
and a senior annotator with over three years of CTI analysis expe-
rience conducts final adjudication. The resulting benchmark com-
prises 1,860 high-quality QA pairs across nine tasks, each grounded
in authoritative CTI sources.

Experiments
We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate retrieval strategies
across the CTI pipeline. We first describe the experimental setup
(§4.1), then present overall performance (§4.2), followed by detailed
analyses including retrieval-paradigm comparisons, full-benchmark
verification, and temporal robustness (§4.3).
4.1
Experimental Setup
Models. We evaluate ten LLMs spanning four proprietary fam-
ilies and three open-source families: GPT-5, GPT-4o (OpenAI);
Claude-Sonnet-4,
Claude-3.5-Haiku
(Anthropic);
Gemini-2.5-
Pro, Gemini-2.5-Flash (Google); Qwen-3-235B (Alibaba); Phi-4
(Microsoft); LLaMA-3-405B, LLaMA-3-8B (Meta). All models are ac-
cessed via their respective APIs with default decoding parameters.
Retrieval Configurations. All task categories are evaluated under
two shared baselines and one domain-specific strategy. Closed-Book
(CB) provides the performance floor by requiring the LLM to an-
swer using only parametric knowledge, measuring how much CTI
knowledge is encoded during pretraining. Vanilla RAG (VR) embeds
the raw query directly (without any query transformation) and
retrieves top-𝑘passages from the knowledge base via cosine simi-
larity against both structured KB entries and unstructured report
chunks. These two baselines isolate the contribution of retrieval
itself (CB →VR) from the contribution of retrieval strategy (VR →
domain-specific).
Beyond these baselines, we analyze vanilla RAG’s failure modes
on each task category and find that they stem from distinct manifes-
tations of the cross-source semantic gap (§4.3.1). Guided by these
failure patterns and the structural properties of each data source,
we design three domain-specific retrieval baselines:
• Extract-then-Retrieve (EtR). For entity linking, the LLM first ex-
tracts the security-relevant semantic content of the input de-
scription (e.g., vulnerability type, weakness mechanism, and im-
pact) and canonicalizes it into keyphrases aligned with the target
knowledge base. The canonicalized keyphrases are then embed-
ded as a dense query for top-𝑘retrieval against the target KB. By
extracting the semantic content from the source-side wording and
re-expressing it in the target-side vocabulary before encoding,
EtR addresses the source–target vocabulary mismatch underly-
ing the cross-source semantic gap, while keeping the retrieval
path itself purely dense.
• CSKG-Guided RAG. For multi-document synthesis, we con-
struct a Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (CSKG) offline using
CTINexus [5]: each report is reduced to a sparse bag of canonical
entities by extracting STIX-aligned named entities and resolving
aliases (e.g., “APT29” ≡“Cozy Bear” ≡“Nobelium”) against a
MITRE-Groups dictionary. At query time, the input report is

processed through the same pipeline, and corpus reports are
ranked against the query entity bag via BM25 with IDF weight-
ing; the top-𝑘reports are retrieved as context. By operating on
canonical entities rather than raw text chunks, CSKG-Guided
RAG bypasses both the entity-aliasing and chunk-noise failure
modes of vanilla RAG that we analyze in Section 4.3.1, and
remains robust to the choice of extraction model (Section A.3).
• Decompose-then-Retrieve (DtR). For entity attribution, DtR first
decomposes the input passage into 𝑁atomic behaviors, canon-
icalizes each into taxonomy-aligned vocabulary, and performs
independent retrieval per behavior before aggregation.
Metrics. For entity linking and entity attribution tasks, we use
Precision, Recall, and F1-score after regex-based identifier normal-
ization. For multi-document synthesis tasks, we use GPT-4 as an
automatic judge guided by a structured rubric. The judge is compre-
hensively validated on a 20% expert-annotated sample, achieving
Cohen’s 𝜅= 0.85 with three CTI experts (inter-human 𝜅= 0.93),
93.9% self-consistency over five runs, and a stylistic-bias differen-
tial of only 0.013 between GPT-family and non-GPT outputs (full
protocol and results in Section A.1).
4.2
Overall Performance on CTIConnect
Overview. Table III presents the performance of ten LLMs across
all nine tasks under three retrieval configurations, evaluated on a
691-pair subset of CTIConnect. With domain-specific retrieval,
models average 74.3% overall, but this aggregate masks stark
asymmetries: entity linking saturates near ceiling (average DS:
97%), while multi-document synthesis (55.3%) and entity attribution
(58.5%) remain substantially below, indicating that these categories
require both better retrieval strategies and stronger model reason-
ing to close the gap. Meanwhile, the overall model ranking is tight
at the top: GPT-5 leads at 81.4%, with three models clustered within
77–78%. However, no single model dominates all categories.
Category Performance. As illustrated in Figure 3 (a), the radar
chart reveals a highly asymmetric capability profile across task
categories. Entity linking with domain-specific retrieval saturates
near ceiling for most models (average DS: 97%), yet collapses to
near-zero under closed-book conditions (average CB: 4.5%), confirm-
ing that these tasks primarily test retrieval rather than parametric
knowledge. Multi-document synthesis remains moderately chal-
lenging (average:55.3%), with performance heavily dependent on
retrieval coverage across vendor reports. Entity attribution exhibits
the widest variance (28%–90%), suggesting that this category most
effectively discriminates model capabilities.
Retrieval Strategy Impact. Figure 4 compares retrieval strate-
gies across all nine tasks. Domain-specific strategies outperform
vanilla RAG in every task category, but the mechanism differs by
retrieval structure: lexical canonicalization via LLM query rewriting
for entity linking, alias resolution for multi-document synthesis,
and decomposition plus canonicalization for entity attribution. For
entity linking, EtR delivers a large average VR→DS gain of ∼31
percentage points (e.g., LLaMA-3-8B WIM: .50→.84; Qwen-3-235B
RCM: .73→1.0): under vanilla RAG, gold entries sit at rank 4.2 on
average—near the edge of the typical top-𝑘=5 window—and are
rarely top-ranked, leaving the LLM to discriminate among lexically
similar candidates; lexical canonicalization sharpens the gold-entry
rank and largely eliminates this discrimination burden. For entity
attribution, vanilla RAG sometimes degrades performance below
closed-book baselines (e.g., GPT-5 ATA: .83→.74; Gemini-2.5-Pro
ATA: .63→.56). This counterintuitive degradation arises because
entity attribution’s one-hop structure means each incorrectly re-
trieved taxonomy entry directly becomes a wrong answer element,
actively harming precision rather than merely failing to help. DtR
addresses this by decomposing narratives into atomic behaviors
before retrieval, improving precision from 34.2% to 71.8%.

Model Rankings. Figure 3 (b) shows that GPT-5 leads at 81.4%,
while the next three models (Qwen-3-235B, GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet-
4) cluster within a narrow 1% band (77.0–77.8%). Importantly, no
single model dominates all categories: Qwen-3-235B (open-source)
tops entity linking with perfect F1 on three tasks, while GPT-5 leads
entity attribution by 25 points over Qwen-3-235B (ATA DS: .90 vs.
.65). This task-specific specialization confirms that CTIConnect
discriminates along multiple capability axes rather than measuring
a single dimension.
4.3
Detailed Analysis
4.3.1
Semantic Gap Analysis. To understand why vanilla RAG fails
on certain task categories, we quantify the cross-source semantic
gap, defined as the difference between query-to-gold and query-to-
top-1 cosine similarity. As shown in Figure 5, the left panel reveals
a clear gradient across task categories: entity linking exhibits
a small gap (0.06), indicating that gold evidence and top-retrieved
entries are closely matched in embedding space. Entity attribution
shows a substantially wider gap (0.31), reflecting the vocabulary
mismatch between analyst-authored narratives and formal taxon-
omy terminology. Multi-document synthesis exhibits the widest
gap (0.43), driven by two compounding effects on vendor reports.
First, entity aliasing: the same threat actor, malware, or campaign
appears under inconsistent names across vendors (e.g., “APT29”
vs. “Cozy Bear”), so embedding similarity often misses relevant
reports that use a different alias than the query. Second, chunk-
level noise: non-content elements (ads, navigation, boilerplate,
generic threat-landscape filler) interleave with the actual intelli-
gence and dilute chunk embeddings, letting lexically similar but
topically unrelated distractors outscore gold documents.
The right panel reveals how the gap manifests in retrieval
ranks. Entity linking gold entries rank 4.2 on average (near the edge
of the typical top-𝑘=5 window), so retrieval mostly succeeds; the
small embedding gap instead surfaces as a candidate-discrimination
difficulty, with the LLM forced to choose among lexically similar
near-neighbors. Entity attribution gold entries fall to rank 6.5, just
outside the retrieval window, because narrative descriptions and
taxonomy entries use fundamentally different linguistic registers.
Multi-document synthesis gold entries rank worst at 9.2: the alias-
ing and chunk-noise effects identified above jointly push gold be-
neath many near-miss distractors. This two-dimensional analysis
(gap severity and retrieval rank) motivates the design of distinct
retrieval strategies for each task category: canonicalization

4.3.2
Evidence Utilization Analysis. Beyond retrieval strategy, we
examine how models utilize retrieved evidence by analyzing perfor-
mance conditioned on retrieval quality across 100 selected instances.
As shown in Figure 6 (a), when retrieval returns correct evidence,
a 28-point utilization gap separates strong-tier models (GPT-5,
Claude-Sonnet-4: 89%) from weak-tier models (LLaMA-3-8B, Phi-4:
61%), indicating that evidence utilization, not just evidence retrieval,
is a bottleneck for smaller models. When retrieval returns incorrect
evidence, strong models partially recover via parametric knowledge
(GPT-5: 42%) while weak models collapse (LLaMA-3-8B: 18%); this
asymmetry is especially damaging for entity attribution, where each
incorrect retrieval directly introduces a wrong answer element.
Figure 6 (b) reveals a complementary pattern: domain-specific
retrieval disproportionately benefits weaker models (weak-tier:
+36.1%; strong-tier: +25.2%), such that weak models with domain-
specific retrieval nearly match strong models with vanilla
RAG. This finding suggests a practical trade-off for system de-
ployment: for resource-constrained settings, investing in domain-
specific retrieval infrastructure yields larger returns than scaling
up model size with generic retrieval.
4.3.3
Model Scaling Analysis. The preceding analyses focus on
retrieval; we now examine whether model choice matters equally
across task categories. As shown in Table IV, scaling from a smaller
to a larger model within the same family yields highly uneven
gains: entity attribution benefits six times more than entity linking
or multi-document synthesis (+19.2% vs. +3.4% and +2.7%).
This asymmetry follows directly from where the performance
bottleneck lies in each category. For entity linking and multi-
document synthesis, the bottleneck is retrieval infrastructure
(whether the system retrieves the right evidence) rather than model
reasoning. Once evidence is retrieved, even smaller models can

perform the required canonicalization or synthesis adequately, so
scaling model size adds little. For entity attribution, the bottleneck
shifts to model capability: DtR requires the model itself to decom-
pose narratives into atomic behaviors and canonicalize each into
taxonomy-aligned vocabulary before retrieval. Every improvement
in decomposition quality directly translates into better retrieval
targets and thus higher F1, explaining why scaling benefits are
largest here (LLaMA-3: +29.5% from 8B to 405B).
This bottleneck analysis also explains the overall leaderboard
structure: GPT-5’s lead over Qwen-3-235B (81.4% vs. 77.8%) con-
centrates almost entirely in entity attribution (ATA DS: .90 vs. .65),
while Qwen-3-235B matches or exceeds all proprietary models on
entity linking and multi-document synthesis. The practical impli-
cation is that model selection should be task-aware: smaller
open-source models suffice for retrieval-bottlenecked categories,
while entity attribution demands stronger model capabilities.
4.3.4
Comparison with General-Purpose Retrieval Improvements.
A natural question is whether the vanilla-to-domain-specific gap
can be closed by recent general-purpose retrieval improvements.
We evaluate two widely-adopted paradigms using GPT-4o as the
default answering model: retrieve-then-rerank (dense retrieval
with text-embedding-3-large followed by reranking the top 50
candidates with the BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3 cross-encoder) and
iterative retrieval (IRCoT [37]; up to 3 rounds of CoT-guided query
refinement). Both share the same encoder as vanilla RAG, isolating
the effect of retrieval paradigm. Table V shows that Rerank and
IRCoT improve over vanilla RAG by 1–5% on average, consistently
smaller than the VR→DS gap of 5–30%. This pattern confirms that
the cross-source CTI semantic gap is not closable by generic
retrieval improvements: it requires structural interventions oper-
ating on the underlying vocabulary and entity-resolution mismatch
(canonicalization, behavior decomposition, entity-graph routing)
rather than incremental improvements to candidate ordering.
4.3.5
Full-Benchmark Verification. Our primary multi-model eval-
uation (Table III) is conducted on a 691-pair subset of CTIConnect,
since running all ten models under three retrieval configurations—
with GPT-4-judge scoring for the synthesis tasks—over the full
benchmark is computationally costly. To confirm that these conclu-
sions hold at full scale, we re-evaluate three representative models
spanning performance tiers—one frontier proprietary (GPT-5), one
mid-tier proprietary (Gemini-2.5-Flash), and one weak-tier (Claude-
3.5-Haiku)—on the complete 1,860-pair benchmark under all re-
trieval configurations. Three findings emerge from Table VI: (1) the
model ranking (GPT-5 > Gemini-2.5-Flash > Claude-3.5-Haiku)

is preserved; (2) the relative difficulty ordering across categories
(EL ≫MDS ≈EA) is preserved; (3) per-category performance pat-
terns are consistent. Absolute scores shift by only 1–3.5% on the
full set, reflecting its broader distribution of harder cases (e.g., rarer
cross-reference mappings and TTP-evolution questions on contra-
dictory reports) rather than any change in measured capability.
4.3.6
Temporal Robustness. A core property of CTI data is its rapid
temporal evolution: new vulnerabilities, threat actors, and adver-
sary techniques emerge continuously. To validate that CTIConnect
generalizes to continually evolving CTI rather than overfitting to
a specific temporal window, we conduct per-task temporal-split
analysis spanning 2008–2025 (full results in Section A.2). Multi-
document synthesis tasks are inherently cross-temporal: CSC, TAP,
and MLA exhibit average temporal spans of 1.8–3.2 years per QA,
with TAP being 100% cross-temporal. For the remaining tasks, we
split at each task’s median temporal cutoff and find that closed-
book, vanilla RAG, and domain-specific performance remain stable
across temporal halves (typical absolute differences fall within ±2%),
indicating that retrieval-based conclusions transfer from the histor-
ical to the recent portion of the benchmark and, by extension, to
continually arriving CTI data.

Conclusion
We introduced CTIConnect, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented LLMs across heterogeneous, multi-source CTI.
The benchmark contains 1,860 high-quality QA pairs grounded in
authoritative CTI sources, produced through a unified construction
pipeline that preserves discriminative structure across scales. Exper-
iments reveal that the cross-source semantic gap is not a uniform
obstacle but manifests differently across task categories (minimal
for entity linking with proper retrieval yet severe for attribution
and synthesis), demanding fundamentally different retrieval strate-
gies rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Equally important, the
performance bottleneck shifts between retrieval infrastructure and
model reasoning depending on task category: smaller open-source
models match frontier proprietary models on retrieval-bottlenecked
tasks, while entity attribution remains gated by model capability.
We further verified that general-purpose retrieval improvements
(retrieve-then-rerank, IRCoT) close only a small fraction of the
vanilla-to-domain-specific gap. These conclusions hold on the full
benchmark and under temporal splits across 2008–2025. These re-
sults point toward LLM-powered security intelligence platforms
that dynamically route analyst queries to task-appropriate retrieval
strategies across heterogeneous knowledge sources. More broadly,
they pave the way for future agentic harness design in cyber threat
intelligence, where the central challenge is equipping agents to
effectively exploit the massive vertical knowledge of the domain.

CTIConnect: A Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented LLMs over Heterogeneous Cyber Threat Intelligence
KDD ’26, August 09–13, 2026, Jeju Island, Republic of Korea
Appendix
A
Validation and Robustness Analyses
This section provides four validation and robustness analyses: LLM-as-a-Judge reliability, temporal robustness, CSKG robustness, and the
Magniber case study. Our code and data are available at our project page: cticonnect.github.io.
A.1
LLM-as-a-Judge Reliability
Multi-document synthesis tasks employ GPT-4 as an automatic judge, scoring atomic claims extracted from model predictions against
reference answers. To rigorously assess the judge’s suitability, consistency, and freedom from systematic bias, we conduct three complementary
experiments on a 20% random sample of MDS instances comprising 115 atomic claims.
Setup. Three CTI experts (each with ≥3 years of practitioner experience) independently scored the 115 claims, achieving an inter-human
Cohen’s 𝜅= 0.93, indicating that the human reference is itself highly reliable.
Experiment 1: Human–LLM Agreement. We computed Cohen’s 𝜅between the GPT-4 judge and the expert-consensus labels. The overall
agreement was 𝜅= 0.85 (“almost perfect”), with per-task values of 𝜅TAP = 0.90, 𝜅MLA = 0.85, and 𝜅CSC = 0.81.
Experiment 2: Self-Consistency. We ran the GPT-4 judge five independent times on the same 115 claims. The judge produced identical
verdicts on 108/115 (93.9%) claims across all five runs, with per-QA score standard deviation of 0.02. The judge is therefore stable rather than
stochastic.
Experiment 3: Stylistic-Bias Detection. A primary concern with LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation is that the judge may favor outputs sharing its
own family’s stylistic patterns. We test this by computing per-claim bias = (judge score −human score) across six representative models
spanning five providers (Table VII).
Table VII: Per-model stylistic bias of the GPT-4 judge. GPT-family mean (+0.021) is comparable to non-GPT mean (+0.008); the
differential Δ = 0.013 is negligible relative to score variance.

Notably, the highest per-model bias is observed for two non-GPT models, Gemini-2.5-Pro (+0.031) and LLaMA-3-405B (+0.029), both
exceeding the GPT-4o bias (+0.024). This rules out a systematic preference of the GPT-4 judge for GPT-family outputs. The aggregate
differential |Δ| = 0.013 is approximately one-third of typical per-task standard deviation, and is therefore negligible for ranking decisions.
Summary. Across the three experiments, the GPT-4 judge demonstrates (i) strong agreement with expert humans, (ii) stable self-consistency,
and (iii) no measurable systematic bias toward its own family. These findings support the validity of LLM-as-a-Judge scoring for the synthesis
tasks in CTIConnect.
A.2
Temporal Generalization
CTIConnect spans CTI data from 2008 to 2025, enabling analysis of whether benchmark conclusions generalize to continually evolving CTI.
Multi-document synthesis tasks are inherently cross-temporal by construction: 67% of CSC QAs span multiple years (average span 1.8 yr),
100% of TAP QAs are cross-temporal (3.2 yr), and 83% of MLA QAs are cross-temporal (3.2 yr).
For entity linking and entity attribution tasks, we split each task at its per-task median temporal cutoff and re-evaluate under all three
retrieval configurations (Table VIII).
Performance is stable across temporal halves under all three retrieval configurations, with typical absolute differences falling within ±2%.
This stability indicates that the benchmark’s discriminative properties transfer from the historical to the recent portion and, by extension,
are expected to hold as CTI data continues to evolve.

CSKG Robustness Analysis
CSKG-Guided RAG (used for multi-document synthesis) constructs a Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph offline by extracting named entities
from each corpus report. To clarify the dependence on the extraction model and provide a transparent cost analysis, this section documents
(1) the model-dependency of CSKG quality and (2) the amortized construction cost.
Scope of Dependency. Of the three domain-specific strategies, two (EtR and DtR) execute their query transformation using the model being
evaluated itself. A weaker answering model therefore naturally produces weaker transformations and lower end-to-end scores, with no
external dependency. CSKG-Guided RAG is the only strategy whose offline graph is built once and shared across all evaluated models.
Robustness Experiment. To isolate the impact of the CSKG-extraction model, we rebuilt the CSKG using GPT-4o-mini (in place of GPT-4o)
and re-evaluated all three MDS tasks with GPT-4o as the answering model (Table IX).
Table IX: CSKG-Guided RAG with GPT-4o vs. GPT-4o-mini as the offline entity extractor. Average degradation is 1.6%.

Average degradation is only 1.6%, indicating that CSKG-Guided retrieval is robust to the underlying extraction model’s capability. The
robustness arises because retrieval scores reports by BM25 over shared canonical entities with IDF weighting, which depends primarily on
whether each canonical entity is extracted at least once, not on subtle differences in extraction phrasing.
Cost Analysis. CSKG construction is a one-time offline cost amortized across all subsequent queries. Per report, CSKG construction
requires approximately 18K input tokens and 3K output tokens. For the full 321-report corpus, the total construction cost is ∼$24 with
GPT-4o and ∼$1.4 with GPT-4o-mini. By comparison, the dominant cost in deployment remains answer-generation, performed once per
query by the evaluated model itself. CSKG construction is therefore a negligible fraction of total operating cost.
A.4
Magniber Cross-Source Correlation Case Study
We illustrate the operational value of cross-source CTI correlation via the Magniber ransomware family, whose six-year operational continuity
is invisible to single-report analysis.
Input. A 2023-03 Google TAG report describing Magniber ransomware actors exploiting a variant of the Microsoft SmartScreen bypass.
CSKG-Guided Retrieval Output. Running CSKG-Guided RAG on the 2023-03 input report surfaces two earlier reports that share many
canonical entities with it:
• ThreatPost (2017-10): documents an earlier Magniber variant targeting South Korean users.
• CrowdStrike (2021-08): describes Magniber’s use of the PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) for victim infection.
Synthesized Intelligence. Linking the three reports reveals a six-year (2017–2023) Magniber campaign with consistent malware family
identity but rotating delivery vectors: geographic targeting evolution (South Korea →broader Windows users), shifting exploitation chains
(initial dropper →PrintNightmare →SmartScreen bypass), and persistent operational infrastructure. None of the three reports alone
establishes this continuity; vanilla RAG fails to surface the 2017 and 2021 reports because vendor-specific naming variations and changing
exploit terminology displace the gold reports below ranking thresholds. This case demonstrates the value of cross-source correlation: it
surfaces patterns that remain invisible to manual, single-report analysis.
