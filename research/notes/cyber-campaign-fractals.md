Abstract. This paper introduces a novel mathematical framework for analyzing cyber threat campaigns through 
fractal geometry. By conceptualizing hierarchical taxonomies (MITRE ATT&CK, DISARM) as snowflake-
like structures with tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques forming concentric layers, we establish a rigorous 
method for campaign comparison using Hutchinson's Theorem and Hausdorff distance metrics. Evaluation 
results confirm that our fractal representation preserves hierarchical integrity while providing a dimensionality-
based complexity assessment that correlates with campaign complexity. The proposed methodology bridges 
security taxonomy analysis and computational geometry, providing analysts with both mathematical rigor and 
interpretable visualizations for addressing the growing complexity of adversarial operations across multiple 
threat domains.

1   Introduction 
The systematic analysis of adversarial campaigns represents one of the most pressing challenges in contemporary 
security research. Whether in the cyber domain (Advanced Persistent Threat groups, APT) or information 
operations (disinformation campaigns), security analysts face increasingly complex, multi-faceted threats that 
deploy diverse tactics, techniques, and procedures. Current approaches rely heavily on manual classification using 
taxonomic frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK for cyber threats and DISARM for disinformation operations 
[1][2].  
These taxonomies organize adversarial behaviors into hierarchical categories, typically using a three-level 
structure organized around a focal point: 
 
• 
Campaign: a grouping of adversaries’ behaviors with a specific timeframe and targeting. 
• 
Tactics: High-level adversarial goals (e.g., "Initial Access" or "Establish Legitimacy"). 
• 
Techniques: Methods to achieve those goals (e.g., "Phishing" or "Create Fake Experts"). 
• 
Sub-techniques: Specific implementations (e.g., "Spearphishing Attachment" or "Use Fake Academic 
Credentials"). 
 
While taxonomically robust, these frameworks lack formal mathematical representations that would enable 
rigorous comparison, aggregation, and detection of structural relationships between campaigns. 
 
We propose a fundamental reconceptualization: viewing hierarchical taxonomy structures as geometric objects 
with fractal properties. This insight emerged from visualizing campaign components as concentric layers (tactics 
at the center, techniques in the middle layer, sub-techniques in the outer layer), revealing structures reminiscent of 
snowflakes when projected on a plane. This visual analogy introduces a powerful mathematical framework—
fractal geometry—that aligns naturally with the hierarchical, self-similar organization of adversarial tactics. 
 
This paper makes the following contributions: 
1. Formally map security taxonomies and fractal geometric structures. 
2. A mathematical framework based on Iterated Function Systems (IFS), Hutchinson's Theorem, and 
Hausdorff distance metrics. 
3. An algorithm for comparing campaign structures  
4. Validation through case studies across multiple security domains 
5. A dimensionality-based complexity measure  
 
A crucial insight of our approach is its domain-agnostic nature. This enables comparative analysis across 
traditionally separate security domains (cyber operations, information warfare, physical security) using a unified 
mathematical language. 
2   Related Works 
2.1   Threat Campaign Modeling 
Existing approaches to threat campaign analysis have primarily focused on graph-based representations. In the 
cyber domain, attack graphs [3] and kill chains [4] provide process-oriented views of attacker progression. For 
information operations, network representations of narratives [5] and communication patterns [6] seem to 
dominate literature. 
 
The MITRE ATT&CK framework has become the de facto standard for cyber threat analysis [7]. DISARM 
frameworks provide structured taxonomies for information operations [1]. However, these frameworks lack formal 
mathematical representations for comparative analysis. 
 
Recent work by Lin et al. introduced a systematic approach to labeling attack tactics specifically tailored for cyber 
threat hunting [8]. Their methodology emphasizes the importance of structured taxonomic labeling in facilitating 
effective threat detection and response, reinforcing the need for rigorous analytical frameworks capable of 
capturing hierarchical tactic structures.

2.2   Fractals in Complex Systems Analysis 
Fractal geometry has been successfully applied to various complex systems, including financial networks [9], 
urban growth patterns [10], and information propagation in social networks [11]. Faloutsos et al. demonstrated 
that internet topology exhibits self-similar patterns consistent with fractal structures [12]. 
In cybersecurity research specifically, fractal dimension has emerged as a promising metric for anomaly detection 
and threat attribution. For example, Siddiqui and Khan applied fractal analysis to APT’s network traffic for 
anomaly detection [13]. They also used fractal dimensions to characterize polymorphic malware behavior 
effectively [14]. Their results demonstrated that fractal-based features significantly improve classification 
accuracy compared to traditional methods, highlighting the potential of fractal geometry in cybersecurity analytics. 
However, the application of fractal geometry to taxonomy-based threat campaign behavioral structure remains 
unexplored. 
2.3   Machine Learning Techniques in Threat Attribution and Detection 
Machine learning techniques have increasingly been employed for advanced persistent threat (APT) attribution 
and detection due to their ability to handle complex data patterns effectively. Charan et al. systematically reviews 
various machine learning approaches and Data Mining techniques applied to APT scenarios (DMAPT) [15]. It 
highlights the strengths and limitations of existing methods, emphasizing the need for robust feature extraction 
techniques capable of capturing structural characteristics inherent in sophisticated threats. 
 
Similarly, Mohamed and Belaton proposes a behavior-based detection approach utilizing machine learning 
classifiers trained on anomalous credential usage patterns in APT attacks (Strange Behaviour Inspection, SBI) 
[16]. This work underscores the value of behavior-driven features in identifying subtle indicators of compromise 
within hierarchical attack structures. 
2.4   Structural Comparison Methods 
Graph similarity metrics seem to dominate structural comparison approaches, with recent work by Koutra et al. on 
fast approximate graph alignment showing promise for large-scale analysis [17]. The application of Hausdorff 
distances to structured data comparison has precedents in bioinformatics [18] and pattern recognition [19]. 
 
2.5   Positioning 
Our proposed geometric framework uniquely integrates fractal geometry with hierarchical security taxonomies, 
addressing gaps identified across existing literature: 
 
• 
Providing a mathematical and intuitive method grounded in fractal geometry. 
• 
Unlike prior fractal-based cybersecurity studies that primarily focus on traffic or malware analysis, we 
apply fractals directly to hierarchical taxonomy modeling. 
• 
Our approach complements existing machine learning-driven methods by offering robust geometric 
feature extraction that can enhance predictive modeling accuracy. 
• 
By formalizing hierarchical taxonomies into geometric objects, our method provides a unified 
mathematical language suitable for cross-domain security analysis—an aspect not addressed explicitly 
by prior literature. 
 
Thus, our paper bridges these previously separate research streams—fractal geometry applications, hierarchical 
taxonomy modeling, structural comparison metrics, and machine learning approaches—into a cohesive analytical 
framework applicable across cybersecurity domains.

3   Theoretical Framework 
3.1   Hierarchical Taxonomy Formalization 
We begin by formalizing hierarchical security taxonomies as multi-level ordered sets. Let a campaign C consist of 
a collection of tactics Ti, each containing techniques τij, which may further contain sub-techniques σijk: 
 
 
𝐶= {𝑇𝑖}𝑖=1
𝑛 , 
𝑇𝑖= {τ𝑖𝑗}𝑗=1 
𝑚𝑖, 
τ𝑖𝑗= {σ𝑖𝑗𝑘}𝑘=1
𝑝𝑖𝑗 
 
This formalization applies equally to cyber campaigns (using MITRE ATT&CK) and information operations 
(using DISARM). 
3.2   Fractal Representation via Iterated Function Systems 
We map this hierarchical structure to fractal geometry through an Iterated Function System (IFS), where each 
taxonomic element corresponds to a contraction mapping in ℝ2: 
 
ℱ𝒞= {𝑓1, 𝑓2, … , 𝑓𝑛} 
 
where each fi is a contraction with factor ri < 1. For hierarchical taxonomies, we define contractions at each level: 
 
𝑟tactic >= 𝑟technique >= 𝑟sub-technique 
 
Following Hutchinson's Theorem, this IFS converges to a unique attractor KC, our "campaign snowflake": 
 
𝐾𝐶= ⋃𝑓𝑖(𝐾𝐶)
𝑛
𝑖=1
 
 
The resulting fractal object KC serves as a unique geometric signature for campaign C. 
 
3.3   Hutchinson Operator and Convergence 
The Hutchinson operator ℋ is defined as: 
 
ℋ(𝑆) = ⋃𝑓𝑖(𝑆)
𝑛
𝑖=1
 
 
for any set S ⊂ ℝ2. Hutchinson's Theorem guarantees that repeated application of this operator converges to the 
unique attractor: 
 
𝐾𝐶= lim
𝑚→∞ℋ𝓂(𝑆0) 
 
for any initial non-empty compact set 𝑆0. 
 
3.4   Fractal Dimension and Campaign Complexity 
The box-counting dimension of the attractor 𝑲𝑪 provides a quantitative measure of campaign complexity: 
dimbox(𝐾𝐶) = lim
ϵ→0
log 𝑁(ϵ)
log(1/ϵ) 


---

where N(ϵ) is the minimum number of squares of side length ϵ needed to cover 𝐾𝐶. For self-similar fractals 
generated by our IFS with uniform contraction factors, this dimension can be approximated by the similarity 
dimension: 
 
dimsim(𝐾𝐶) = log(𝑛)
log(1/𝑟) 
 
where n is the number of contractions and r is the contraction factor (assuming all factors are equal). 
 
When implementing strict hierarchical contraction factors (𝑟tactic > 𝑟technique > 𝑟sub-technique) the similarity 
dimension is instead determined by the unique value of (𝑑) that satisfies the implicit equation: 
 
∑𝑟𝑖
𝑑
𝑖
= 1 
 
This equation can be expanded for our three-level hierarchy as: 
 
[ ∑(𝑟tactic)𝑑
𝑛tactic
𝑖=1
+
∑
(𝑟technique)
𝑑
𝑛technique
𝑗=1
+
∑
(𝑟sub-technique)
𝑑
𝑛sub-technique
𝑘=1
= 1] 
 
Which simplifies to: 
 
[𝑛tactic ⋅(𝑟tactic)𝑑+ 𝑛technique ⋅(𝑟technique)
𝑑+ 𝑛sub-technique ⋅(𝑟sub-technique)
𝑑= 1] 
 
 
Where (𝑛tactic), (𝑛technique), and (𝑛sub-technique) represent the count of elements at each level. 
3.5   Comparison Metrics: Hausdorff 
For comparing campaigns, we employ the Hausdorff distance: 
 
𝑑𝐻(𝐾𝐶1, 𝐾𝐶2) = max { sup
𝑥∈𝐾𝐶1
inf
𝑦∈𝐾𝐶2
𝑑(𝑥, 𝑦), sup
𝑦∈𝐾𝐶2
inf
𝑥∈𝐾𝐶1
𝑑(𝑥, 𝑦)} 
 
4   Methodology 
4.1   Snowflake Generation Algorithm 
The transformation from hierarchical taxonomy to fractal snowflake follows a deterministic process: 
1. Map campaign tactics to central nodes with angular separation θ=2π/n for n tactics 
2. For each tactic node, generate technique branches with specified contraction factor rtech 
3. For each technique branch, generate sub-technique nodes with contraction factor rsubtech 
 
The algorithm implements Hutchinson's operator ℋ iteratively: 
 
𝑋𝑛+1 = ℋ(𝑋𝑛) = ⋃𝑓𝑖(𝑋𝑛)
𝑚
𝑖=1
 
Where fi are the contractions corresponding to taxonomy elements, producing the attractor KC as n→∞. 
 
 


---

4.2   Snowflake Generation Algorithm 
Campaign similarity is assessed through a three-stage process: 
1. Apply the Hutchinson operator to produce attractors KC1 and KC2 
2. Compute the Hausdorff distance dH(KC1,KC2) 
3. Convert to similarity score via Sim(𝐶1, 𝐶2) = 𝑒−λ𝑑𝐻(𝐾𝐶1,𝐾𝐶2) 
 
For campaign subset detection (e.g., C3⊂C1), we examine both the Hausdorff distance (approaching zero) and the 
dimensional relationship: 
 
𝑑𝐻(𝐾𝐶3, 𝐾𝐶1) ≈0 and 
dim(𝐾𝐶3) < dim(𝐾𝐶1) 
5   Case Study 
To demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our fractal-based framework for hierarchical attack taxonomy 
modeling, we present four case studies spanning both cyber and disinformation campaigns. These examples 
highlight the ability of our method to model campaigns at different levels of granularity, detect subset relationships, 
and compare structurally similar yet distinct operations. The selected campaigns include both Advanced Persistent 
Threat (APT) operations and disinformation campaigns, illustrating the domain-agnostic nature of our approach. 
 
5.1   APT29: Modeling an APT Group-Level Campaign 
APT29, also known as "Cozy Bear," is a sophisticated Russian state-sponsored threat actor group. Its operations 
typically focus on cyber-espionage targeting government entities, think tanks, and private sector organizations. At 
the APT group level, we model APT29's general tactics and techniques based on MITRE ATT&CK, but we choose 
to not be exhaustive as it is not useful for the sake of the mathematical demonstration.

5.2   APT29 SolarWinds Campaign: Subset Detection 
The SolarWinds campaign, attributed to APT29, represents a highly targeted subset of the group's broader 
operational capabilities. This campaign exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform to compromise supply chains 
and infiltrate U.S. government agencies. At the APT specific campaign level, we model APT29's general tactics 
and techniques based on MITRE ATT&CK, but we choose to not be exhaustive as it is not useful for the sake of 
the mathematical demonstration.

5.3   "Matriochka" Disinformation Campaign 
The "Matriochka" campaign, analyzed by VIGINUM (SGDSN, French Government), represents a complex 
disinformation operation attributed to Russian actors. Its goal was to manipulate public opinion by creating layers 
of false narratives ("matryoshka dolls") that concealed their origins. (See Appendix n°1 for DISARM mapping) 
 
5.4   APT28 DNC Hack (influence campaign) 
APT28 (Fancy Bear), another Russian state-sponsored group, conducted a disinformation operation targeting the 
Democratic National Committee (DNC) during the U.S. presidential election in 2016. This operation combined 
cyber intrusion with narrative manipulation to influence public opinion. (See Appendix n°2 for DISARM mapping) 
5.5   Results 
These case studies demonstrate that our fractal-based framework effectively models hierarchical attack structures 
across domains, detects subset relationships (e.g., SolarWinds ⊂ APT29), and quantifies campaign complexity 
through fractal dimensions (code available at Appendix 3).

Dimension analysis 
The hierarchical fractal dimensions using hierarchical contraction factors  
 
(𝑟tactic = 0,6 ; 𝑟technique = 0,4 ;  𝑟sub-technique = 0,2) 
 
are consistently higher than those calculated with the simplified formula.

This indicates that the simplified approach underestimates campaign complexity when properly accounting for the 
hierarchical nature of security taxonomies, but:  
1. Relative rankings remain consistent: Matriochka is still the most complex campaign, followed by DNC 
Hack and APT29, and finally SolarWinds. 
2. Hierarchical importance is properly represented: The corrected approach gives appropriate weight to the 
different taxonomic levels. 
3. Subset relationship is preserved: SolarWinds still has a lower dimension than APT29, confirming its 
subset status. 
 
Despite both APT29 and DNC Hack having the same total number of elements (15) in our use case, their different 
distribution across taxonomic levels results in distinct fractal dimensions when using hierarchical contraction 
factors. 
 
This mathematical outcome actually aligns with an important aspect of threat analysis: 
• 
Higher level of detail at the sub-technique level: DNC Hack uses fewer tactics but implements them with 
more specific sub-techniques, representing a more detailed implementation of a narrower tactical 
approach. 
• 
Tactical breadth vs. technical depth: APT29 employs more tactics (broader approach) but with less 
elaboration at the sub-technique level, while DNC Hack demonstrates greater technical depth within a 
more focused tactical scope. 
 
This analysis demonstrates that while the simplified formula provides a useful approximation, the implicit equation 
approach better captures the hierarchical nature of security taxonomies. 
 
Distance 
Using the hierarchical contraction factors with r_tactic=0.6, r_tech=0.4, and r_subtech=0.2, we obtain: 
 
Table 6.  Hausdorff Distance Calculation for Cyber Campaign Fractals 
Campaign pair 
 
Hausdorff distance 
APT29 - SolwarWinds 
 
0.384 
Matriochka - DNCHack 
 
0.640 
 
The Hausdorff distance between APT29 and SolarWinds (0.384) is significantly smaller than between Matriochka 
and DNC Hack (0.640), which aligns with the paper's settings that SolarWinds campaign is a subset of APT29's 
broader capabilities. 
A python code for implicit equation is available at Appendix 4.

Sensitivity analysis 
To understand how contraction factors affect the Hausdorff distance calculation, we performed additional 
computations with varying parameters: 
Table 7.  Impact of Contraction Factor on Hausdorff Distance Calculation for Cyber Campaign Fractals 
Contraction factors 
APT29-SolarWinds 
Matriochka-DNCHack 
r_t=0.5, r_te=0.3, r_s=0.1 
0.3200 
0.5333 
r_t=0.6, r_te=0.4, r_s=0.2 
0.3840 
0.6400 
r_t=0.7, r_te=0.5, r_s=0.3 
0.4480 
0.7467 
 
While the absolute values differ substantially, the relative ordering remains consistent: the APT29-SolarWinds 
relationship consistently demonstrates greater similarity than Matriochka-DNCHack across all parameter choices. 
6   Discussion 
This work demonstrates the versatility of a fractal-based framework for modeling and comparing hierarchical 
threat campaigns across domains, such as computer network operations and disinformation.  
 
Using fractal with hierarchical contraction factors 
 
While our hierarchical fractal representation uses contraction factors where rtactic > rtechnique > rsubtechnique to 
emphasize taxonomic structure, this ordering produces an interesting effect on dimension calculations. Campaigns 
with more sub-techniques relative to tactics (like DNC Hack) yield higher dimensions than campaigns with more 
tactics but fewer sub-techniques (like APT29), even when total element counts are identical. This mathematically 
captures how technical depth at lower taxonomy levels can contribute more to overall campaign complexity than 
tactical breadth—an insight aligned with threat analysis practice where sophisticated actors demonstrate more their 
capabilities at the technical implementations level rather than employing a wide range of tactics, emphasizing the 
discriminative nature of techniques over tactics. 
 
On the choice of contraction factors 
 
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the choice of contraction factors, while preserving insigths, significantly 
impacts the absolute values of Hausdorff distances. This has important methodological implications: 
1. Practitioners should calibrate their interpretation of Hausdorff distances based on the specific contraction 
factors used, rather than relying on absolute thresholds. 
2. Threat analysts should focus on relative relationships between campaign pairs rather than absolute 
distance values. 
3. For operational use, the security community would benefit from standardized contraction factors to enable 
consistent cross-organizational comparisons. 
 
The sensitivity analysis reveals that while the absolute values of Hausdorff distances are highly dependent on 
parameter choices, the fundamental threat analysis insights remain robust. The fractal framework continues to 
provide valuable comparative information about campaign relationships, supporting attribution decisions and 
complexity assessments despite parameter variation. 
 
Integrated Cyber-Disinformation Campaigns 
The DNC Hack by APT28 exemplifies a hybrid campaign combining cyber intrusion (e.g., data exfiltration) with 
disinformation (e.g., leak amplification). Our framework can seamlessly integrate such multi-domain operations 
by introducing an innermost concentric layer branching into domain-specific frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK 
(cyber) and DISARM (disinformation). Subsequent layers represent their respective tactics, techniques, and sub-
techniques. This unified representation enables cross-domain analysis (cyber operations, information warfare, 
physical security) while preserving the hierarchical integrity of each framework.

Comparison to Previous Work 
In your previous work on APT behavioral signatures [20], the focus was on paired techniques—capturing 
interrelations between techniques within a campaign. While this approach excels in identifying operational 
patterns, it lacks the hierarchical perspective provided by our fractal model. Conversely, our framework 
emphasizes the branching structure of campaigns but does not explicitly capture interrelations within a single 
concentric layer (e.g., dependencies between techniques). This highlights complementary strengths: 
• 
Fractal Model: Ideal for quantifying complexity and detecting structural overlaps or subsets when we 
have a broad coverage of the mapped behavior. 
• 
Paired Techniques: Better suited for analyzing intra-layer relationships and operational dependencies 
when information is more limited about the observed campaign’s behavior. 
Future work could combine these approaches to create a hybrid model that captures both hierarchical branching 
and interrelations within layers. 
Limitations 
While effective for hierarchical modeling, this approach does not capture dependencies within a single layer 
(e.g., paired techniques in ATT&CK). This limits its ability to analyze operational sequences. 
The framework relies on precise mappings to established taxonomies (e.g., DISARM, ATT&CK). Errors or 
omissions can distort results. 
Calculating Hausdorff distances becomes resource-intensive for large datasets. 
The sensivity analysis highlight the importance of careful parameter selection and standardization for operational 
applications in threat intelligence, that is not covered in this research. 
7   Conclusion 
We have presented a novel approach to threat campaign analysis through fractal geometry, establishing a 
mathematical foundation for comparing hierarchical attack structures across both cyber and information security 
domains. By conceptualizing taxonomic elements from frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and DISARM as 
snowflake-like fractal patterns, we enable both computational precision and intuitive visualization of complex 
threat landscapes. 
The application of Hutchinson's Theorem provides a formal mechanism for generating unique campaign 
signatures regardless of domain, while Hausdorff distance offers a principled metric for assessing structural 
relationships between campaigns. Our case studies demonstrate the approach's ability to detect campaign subsets 
(e.g., SolarWinds within APT29), measure similarity between independent operations, and quantify complexity 
across cyber operations and disinformation campaigns alike. 
This work establishes a new bridge between security taxonomy research and computational geometry, offering 
analysts both mathematical rigor and visual intuition for addressing the growing complexity of adversarial 
campaigns. The domain-agnostic nature of our framework makes it particularly valuable for analyzing hybrid 
threats that span multiple domains, such as the APT28 DNC Hack which combined cyber intrusion with 
disinformation tactics. 
As adversarial tactics continue to evolve across both cyber and information domains, geometric approaches may 
prove increasingly valuable in recognizing patterns across seemingly disparate operations, enhancing attribution 
capabilities, and ultimately improving defensive postures against sophisticated threats.
